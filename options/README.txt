A General Training Strategy

Our proposed Model Contrastive paradigm is designed as a general training strategy. The core idea—using the model's own training history to create negative samples—can be broadly applied to enhance various models and tasks beyond the examples in our paper. When integrating this method into your own projects, please pay attention to the optimal hyperparameters.
